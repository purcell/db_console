DBConsole
=========

Ever tried using 'psql' or 'mysql' on the command-line to connect to your Rails database,
only to find you forgot all those '-u' and '-h' parameters?

This plugin provides handy rake tasks for running DB console programs for the various databases
in your database.yml.  It supports postgresql, mysql, sqlite and sqlite3 connections.

The plugin's home on the web is here:
